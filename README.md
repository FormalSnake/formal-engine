## Formal Engine

At the moment, it is just a C# console project using OpenTK, it features 3D, a free camera, lighting and textures!
This is technically not a game engine yet, at the moment it is a modular sample 3D OpenTK project to kickstart your development,

## Building the Code

As this codebase is currently not ready for release, I can't make any guarantees about whether it will build for you. However, the process is pretty straightforward for anyone who wants to try:

1. Clone the *formal-engine* repository
3. Open ```FormalEngine.sln``` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
4. Build the solution

That should be all! Assuming your computer has OpenGL 4 or DirectX11 support, the game window should open immediately.

**You are now ready to begin development!**
